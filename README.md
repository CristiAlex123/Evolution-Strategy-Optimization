# Evolution Strategy Optimization of the Ackley Function

This project implements a self-adaptive Evolution Strategy in Python to optimize the **Ackley function**. The algorithm uses discrete recombination and self-adaptive mutation, with statistical evaluation and visualization across multiple problem dimensions.

# What It Does:
- Implements a (μ + λ) Evolution Strategy
- Uses:
  - **Ackley function** 
  - **Discrete recombination** 
  - **Self-adaptive mutation** 
- Compares performance across dimensions: `n = 2, 3, 30`
- Creates:
  - 3D visualization of the function
  - Fitness evolution plots
  - Boxplots with statistics
